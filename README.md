What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
========================================
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and summarizing data to understand its main characteristics before performing detailed analysis or modeling. It involves using visualizations, statistics, and summary metrics to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.

Use of EDA:
================
Understand Data: Identify data types, distributions, relationships, and patterns.
Clean Data: Detect missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
Prepare for Modeling: Select the most relevant features and transformations.
Make Informed Decisions: Gain insights for better business strategies or problem-solving.

Examples of EDA:
================
1. Cuisine Rating Dataset:

> Finding the average ratings for different cuisines.
> Identifying popular cuisines in specific regions.

2. Telecom Data:

> Understanding customer churn patterns.
