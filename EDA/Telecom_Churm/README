What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use tools for handling structured data like tables.

What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

EDA involves analyzing and visualizing data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain insights.

Why EDA?
> Understand data structure and quality
> Identify trends, relationships, and anomalies
> Prepare data for advanced analysis or modeling

Features Implemented  : 

> Sorting and retrieving data
> Applying functions to cells, columns, and rows
> Grouping and summary tables
> DataFrame transformations
> Initial churn prediction attempts

Tools Used : 

> Pandas: Data manipulation
> Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
